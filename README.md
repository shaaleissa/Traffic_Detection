    <h1>Comparative Analysis of YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 Model Performance in Object Detection Project</h1>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This repository provides a comprehensive comparison between YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 models in the realm of object detection. It includes various Jupyter notebooks that detail the processes of detection, training, evaluation, and data preprocessing.</p>

    <h2>Repository Structure</h2>
    <h3>Notebooks Directory</h3>
    <p>This directory is organized into several subdirectories, each containing Jupyter notebooks for specific tasks:</p>

    <h4>Detection Directory</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>YOLOv5_detection.ipynb</li>
        <li>YOLOv8_detection.ipynb</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These notebooks are dedicated to object detection using YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models, respectively.</p>

    <h4>Training and Evaluation Directory</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>YOLOv5_training_evaluation.ipynb</li>
        <li>YOLOv8_training_evaluation.ipynb</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These notebooks cover the training and evaluation phases for both YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models.</p>

    <h4>Data Preprocessing</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>data_preprocessing.ipynb</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Contains the exploratory data analysis and preprocessing steps.</p>

    <h3>Predict Directory</h3>
    <p>Contains results from object detection experiments using both YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models.</p>

    <h3>Models Directory</h3>
    <p>Stores the best-performing weights for both YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models, trained on custom datasets.</p>

    <h3>Images Directory</h3>
    <p>Includes all images utilized in the object detection experiments.</p>

    <h2>Usage Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Training and Evaluation: The training and evaluation processes were conducted using Kaggle notebooks. Ensure you have the necessary environment to run these notebooks.</li>
        <li>Detection: The detection notebooks can be run locally, provided that the model weights are placed in the models directory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone the repository.</li>
        <li>Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or use Kaggle notebooks for training and evaluation purposes.</li>
        <li>For detection tasks, download the pre-trained weights and place them in the models directory.</li>
        <li>Run the notebooks to perform detection, training, evaluation, and data preprocessing.</li>
    </ol>
