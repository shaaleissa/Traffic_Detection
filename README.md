# Comparative Analysis of YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 Model Performance in Object Detection Project
 
# Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive comparison between YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 models in the realm of object detection. It includes various Jupyter notebooks that detail the processes of detection, training, evaluation, and data preprocessing.

# Repository Structure

## Notebooks Directory
This directory is organized into several subdirectories, each containing Jupyter notebooks for specific tasks:

## Detection Directory

YOLOv5_detection.ipynb
YOLOv8_detection.ipynb
These notebooks are dedicated to object detection using YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models, respectively.
Training and Evaluation Directory

YOLOv5_training_evaluation.ipynb
YOLOv8_training_evaluation.ipynb
These notebooks cover the training and evaluation phases for both YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models.
Data Preprocessing

data_preprocessing.ipynb
Contains the exploratory data analysis and preprocessing steps.
Predict Directory
Contains results from object detection experiments using both YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models.
## Models Directory
Stores the best-performing weights for both YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models, trained on custom datasets.
## Images Directory
Includes all images utilized in the object detection experiments.
# Usage Instructions

Training and Evaluation: The training and evaluation processes were conducted using Kaggle notebooks. Ensure you have the necessary environment to run these notebooks.
Detection: The detection notebooks can be run locally, provided that the model weights are placed in the models directory.

# Getting Started

## To get started with this project:

- Clone the repository.
- Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or use Kaggle notebooks for training and evaluation purposes.
- For detection tasks, download the pre-trained weights and place them in the models directory.
- Run the notebooks to perform detection, training, evaluation, and data preprocessing.
