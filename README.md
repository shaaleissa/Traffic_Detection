This Repositry contains 4 direcorties

# - in the notebooks directory there is:
      - detection directory
          which contains 2 Juypter notebooks:
                - for yolov5 detection
                - for yolov8 detection
      - training and evaluation directory
          which contains 2 Juypter notebooks:
                - for yolov5 training and evaluation
                - for yolov8 training and evaluation
      - Juypter notebook named 'data_preprocessing' which contains the exploratory data analysis
